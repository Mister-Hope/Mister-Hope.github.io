# Autumn Recollection

::: center

I believe，

there is always someone,

or something,

which can hold in heart,

Worthy to be memorized the whole life

But sometimes,

people need to suffer lies,

to stand beguilement,

to forget promises,

and then they gradually know that:

Holding on does not mean Victory,

and Oblivion does not mean Apathy.
